			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<p>When I was a kid, my grandfather introduced me to a TV show called Star Trek. It's mission was simple, but powerful: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no one has gone before. Never before or since has something so perfectly captured the essence of my heart.</p>
			<p>Star Trek is a TV show with action and science, but it is so much more than that. It is about discovering the world around you, and learning more about yourself. It is about always striving to be better than you were yesterday. That is what ultimately led me to programming.</p>
			<p>In this field, I can make a better world and a better future one line of code at a time.</p>
			<p>Star Trek: Starship Commander is a text-based browser game, where you will take the Captain's chair. You will command an upgradeable starship. You will lead a customizable staff of senior officers. You will explore those strange new worlds in a dynamic galaxy that changes as you level up. You will seek out new life and new civilizations in story-driven missions. You will boldly go where no one has gone before.</p>
			<h2>The process</h2>
			<p>I started by building out the wireframe, and writing out the datatables and their information. Following that, I built out the framework of the game, then did the basic styling. Once the their was something to look at and a working navigation system, I began the more complex queries that would create, display, and change the users' information. Finally, once the game mechanics worked together, i went back and added the more advanced styling.</p>
			<h2>The libraries</h2>
			<p>For this project, I used Backbone for the navigation, and React for everything else in the coding. For the back-end, I used Parse. For the styling, I used CSS with SASS.</p>

			<a class="siteTag" href="http://amicko.github.io/jquery-image-board/">The Website</a>
			<h2>The Image Board</h2>
			<p>The idea of conveying images to others to share what makes me happy has always been appealing, even back in the days of yahoo messenger. Since the majority of people are visual learners, it is an excellent way to learn of others and to help others learn of you.</p>
			<p>I decided that an image board site would be a great addition to my portfolio for just that reason, it will not only stand as an example of my ability but also as an opportunity to share my personal interests with you, in helping you to understand who I am.</p>
			<h2>The process</h2>
			<p>In my class, we originally did a version of this as homework using a heroku app. I went back and rebuilt the site with jQuery but connected the site to a Parse back-end server.</p>
			<h2>The libraries</h2>
			<p>For this project I used jQuery for the client side and Parse for the back-end.</p>

			<a class="siteTag" href="http://amicko.github.io/jquery-chatroom/">The Website</a>
			<h2>The Chatroom</h2>
			<p>When I was much younger, and still a relatively new fan to Star Trek, I stumbled upon a Star Trek chatroom. It was called Outpost 10 Forward, and was one of the preimminent scifi websites during the nineties and early 2000s. There, you could create an account in their Star Trek, Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings realms and chat with other like fans. the site was so famous, they regularly had celebrities coming online to role play as famous Scifi characters.</p>
			<p>It also offered unique features on their site. Every user had a rank, which they could improve with active participation and good behavior. Each rank increased your access to the site with more basic html and css, access to the armory(a site feature in itself which gave you the ability to protect the site from those who would try to abuse it), and webpages only availabe to certain ranks. As you increased in rank, you were also promoted to better site positions and given teams of other users to lead in improving the site itself.</p>
			<p>It was because of this site that my initial interest in programming started. When I saw other users putting in html and css and creating pictures, and different colors in their chat messages I wanted to do that too. I wanted to help the website by making improvements to the code. However, I didn't know how. So I began learning.</p>
			<h2>The process</h2>
			<p>I decided I wanted to recreate some of what I saw at the site, namely the chat feature itself. I did that to see if I could, after all that I learned, make the very site that drew me to programming all thos eyears ago.</p>
			<p>I felt that jQuery offered the most versatile library to work with in what I wanted to do, and then added connections to a Parse server to store the messages themselves.</p>
			<h2>The libraries</h2>
			<p>For this project, I used jQuery for the client side, and for the back end I worked with Parse.com.</p>
